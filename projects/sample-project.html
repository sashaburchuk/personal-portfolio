      <p class="paragraph">
        I've attempted many things in my life and believe that I am the sum of those parts. 
        When I was younger I travelled and lived abroad so that I could write about countries 
        in revolution and community movements. Then I worked for the Oregon State Legislature 
        because I believed that systematic change was necessary. Afterwards I developed an 
        interest in technology and the psychology of advertising and became a front-end developer
        at a leading agency. At some point I was overcome by the urge to touch and feel the things 
        I was building so I started working with wood.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">My work focuses on supporting and nurturing quiet reflection. Creating openness through the use 
        of space, light, and form to influence human habits and behavioral patterns.</p>
